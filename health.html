							<p class="font-weight-bold">One year after your last cigarette</p>
							<p>After one year of quitting smoking, your lungs will have experienced dramatic health improvements in terms of capacity and functioning. You’ll notice how much easier you breathe when you’re exerting yourself and how much less coughing you have compared to when you smoked.</p>
							<p>In addition to these health benefits, you’ll have saved a dramatic amount of money. Smoking cigarettes is expensive. If you smoked a pack of cigarettes per day, you’ll have saved thousands of dollars at the one-year mark.</p>

						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="font-weight-bold">10 years after your last cigarette</p>
							<p>At the decade mark, your risk of dying due to lung cancer has decreased to that of a nonsmoker. The cells that were previously precancerous are now replaced with healthy cells.</p>
							<p>In addition to decreasing the risks for lung cancer, your risk of developing smoking-related illnesses also goes down. This includes a reduced risk for cancers of the mouth, esophagus, bladder, kidneys and pancreas
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="font-weight-bold">15 years after your last cigarette</p>
							<p>At the 15-year mark, your risk for heart attack and stroke has decreased to equal that of a person who’s never smoked before. While it can take time to turn back the clock on the effects of smoking, having 15 smoke-free years represents a major milestone for your health and overall well-being.</p>
